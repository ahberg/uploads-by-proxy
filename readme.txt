For local development: Automatically load images from the production version of wp-content/uploads if they are missing locally.

== Description ==

This plugin is meant to be used by developers who work on sites in a local development environment before deploying changes to a production (live) server. It allows you skip downloading the contents of `wp-content/uploads` to your local WordPress install. Instead, images missing from the uploads directory are loaded from the production server as needed.
